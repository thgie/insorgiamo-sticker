# INSORGIAMO Sticker
I read an article on the Insorgiamo movement in Italy. The fine people of a GKN factory in Firenze took over their workplace when everybody got fired. Since then they came up with a plan on how to work together, equally and in accordance with the climate-crisis.

After searching for some graphic material, I haven't found a sticker with their famous banner. So here is one.
